# Vim Language Server Client

This is an experiment with building a partial replacement for plugins like
YouCompleteMe. Eventually I hope to have it communicate with a language server
following the [language server protocol][language-server-protocol]

[language-server-protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)

Don't expect this to do anything useful for a while.
